Q - edit path isn't working from Jobs' show page. The info is getting edited, but there is an error on redirecting.



TO DO
Create a new table in Rails
bin/rails g model Product name:string count:integer description:text ...ETC!
** bin/rails generate model Table column:string column:text other_table_name:references

For references, make sure to actually set up the relationships in the models!
Also set them up in Routes.rb (config files)

Running migrations
bin/rake db:migrate

Make controller and other files
$ bin/rails generate controller table_name_plural

EX:
$ bin/rails generate model Tag name:string
$ bin/rails generate model Tagging tag:references article:references
$ bin/rake db:migrate

rails g model Comment content:text job:references
rails g model Category title:string job:references
rails g model Contact first_name last_name email position company:references
