Q - how to relate categories and jobs? I need help making the column changes. Figure out what I need first. A job has one category. Categories can have many jobs. I need to add the FK to jobs.



TO DO
Create a new table in Rails
bin/rails g model Product name:string count:integer description:text ...ETC!
** bin/rails generate model Table column:string column:text other_table_name:references

For references, make sure to actually set up the relationships in the models!
Also set them up in Routes.rb (config files)

Running migrations
bin/rake db:migrate

Make controller and other files
$ bin/rails generate controller table_name_plural

EX:
$ bin/rails generate model Tag name:string
$ bin/rails generate model Tagging tag:references article:references
$ bin/rake db:migrate

rails g model Comment content:text job:references
rails g model Category title:string
rails g model Contact first_name last_name email position company:references

rails g migration AddJobToCategory job:references
bin/rails g migration RemoveCategoryFromJob category
