Q - how to relate categories and jobs? I need help making the column changes. Figure out what I need first. A job has one category. Categories can have many jobs. I need to add the FK to jobs.

Q - adding comment goes to the right job, but the redirect goes to the wrong page - it goes to the first company's job/show page....or just errors out in the Job Controller.

Q - lots of trouble with tests! AAAAAND, no feature tests yet!
